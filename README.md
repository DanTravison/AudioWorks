AudioWorks
==========

A cross-platform, multi-format audio conversion and tagging suite written in C# and featuring a PowerShell front-end. Codecs currently supported are MP3, MP4 AAC, FLAC, Apple Lossless (ALAC) and Ogg Vorbis.

This project is intended to supplant [PowerShell Audio](https://github.com/jherby2k/PowerShellAudio) by targetting both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core (Windows, Linux and Mac OSX).
