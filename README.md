AudioWorks
==========

A cross-platform, multi-format audio conversion and tagging suite

This project is intended to supplant [PowerShell Audio](https://github.com/jherby2k/PowerShellAudio) with cross-platform code, using .NET Standard 2.0 libraries and PowerShell Core. Development is being done "from scratch" using test-driven methedology. APIs are subject to change, although that is TBD.
