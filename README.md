AudioWorks
==========

A cross-platform, multi-format audio conversion and tagging suite

This project is intended to supplant [PowerShell Audio](https://github.com/jherby2k/PowerShellAudio) with cross-platform code (Windows, Mac and Linux), by targeting the .NET Standard 2.0 specification and PowerShell Core. Development is being done "from scratch" using test-driven methedology. APIs are subject to change.

Release is tentatively planned for the second quarter of 2018 (this is dependent on stable releases of ImageSharp and System.Memory).
